# Welcome to Battleship game

This is the command-Line based version of the popular board game Battleship. You can play single-player or even **multi-player**!

There are 2 versions, one which keeps a log of all the players that played the game, by using **SQL**. Other just lets you enjoy the game.

If you want to use the No-SQL version, please switch the branch to **"BSP-noSQL"** and read further instructions in its readme file.
